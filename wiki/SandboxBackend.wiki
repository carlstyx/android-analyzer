= Purpose =
A dedicated backend server allows plugin developers to create, test, inspect and fine-tune plugin output within a sandbox environment. This way, temporary results generated during development will not intertwine with the real device data posted to the production server at [http://AndroidFragmentation.com]

= Usage =
The Sandbox Backend runs on [http://212.95.166.45:8080]. The new functionality of the production server will be staged at the Sandbox Backend first, so new features will be applied all across the site for the plugin developers to get acquainted first. However, on the Sandbox Backend the data in the news, forums and database sections will always be considered as *temporary test data* and will be deleted periodically. Therefore, please *do not* use the Sandbox Backend to post anything other than test content.

The link to the device database section on the Sandbox Backend is:
