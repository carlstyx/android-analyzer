#summary Covers the specifics of the development and contribution processes

= Introduction =

This page provides guidelines about the process of development and contribution of AnalyzerPlugins. 

= Details =

There are already some steps defined which describe the process of creating and submitting plugins. Here are the main ones:
  * New plugin is proposed in the tracker and/or group.
  * Plugin proposal is discussed and approved by the project owners.
  * Page for the plugin is created [Plugins here]. The page must contain detailed specification of the plugin design:
    * Tree-like structure of the data that will be collected (hierarchy of nodes, subnodes, leaves ). An example is available [DeviceInfoPlugin here]
    * Metrics of the collected ordinal values
    * Methods for retrieving data
    * Data structure must be future-proof, though the initial version of the plugin may not implement it entirely
  * Plugin design is approved by the project owners 
  * Timeline and assignments are discussed. 
  * When plugin is implemented, another person is assigned to make code review and post relevant tracker issues, that are ultimately fixed/addressed.

When all of the above steps are completed, the ready plugin is integrated in the AndroidAnalyzer application and is distributed with the next release.
